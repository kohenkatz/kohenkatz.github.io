## About

This repository hosts the HTML, CSS, images, and posts for [moshe.ymkatz.net](http://moshe.ymkatz.net).

## Publishing

This blog is generated with the [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) engine.
Simple and easy formatting that sticks to the basics.
All static HTML too, so worrying about scalability is non-existent.
And GitHub is nice enough to host it for free.
